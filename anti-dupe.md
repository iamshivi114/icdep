# Anti-Duplication

This proposal provides a solution to prevent duplication of an index card.

In order to ensure that any index card is not duplicated we can have a **five-digit alpha numberic code** that is generated by the sender.
This *anti-duplication code* can be present at the top right of the index card and also at the back of it.
The code at the back would be covered by an opaque piece of paper that once uncovered, cannot be put back again. Hence, if the end user finds the code at the back to be uncovered, they can deem the index card to be invalid.
Once the end user gets the index card, they can get the uncover the anti-duplication code at the back of it and match the code with the one at the top right of the front of the index card.
If the code matches, they would know that the index card is valid.
