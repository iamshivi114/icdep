# Administration

This proposal provides a way to send commands to individual nodes in the network, rather than than treat them as pass-through intermediaries.

To send commmands to individual nodes in a network we would make use of the identity numbers that were introduced for each node in the extension section.
Since now we have a way to differentiate each node, we can mention any command we may have for any particular node next to their number.
I propose that in the only remaining corner on the index card (the bottom left), we add the number of the node the command is addressed to, followed by the command. Both the number and the command can be separated by a hyphen "-".
We can add multiple commands if needed by separating them using semi-colons ";".
